## Highlight-Performance test project
This project provides a sample usage of the Aspose.Pdf functionality for highlighting text strings in a pdf document.  It is useful for testing the performance of the highlight functionality.

### Note:
In order to use this you'll need to add a valid aspose.pdf license file to the executable directory (ie \bin\debug).
